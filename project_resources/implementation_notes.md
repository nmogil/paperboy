  - Added batch processing with rate limiting
  - Implemented fallback mechanisms for content extraction
- **Next Steps**:
  - Add more comprehensive error handling for network issues
  - Implement content caching to improve performance
  - Consider adding support for more article formats

### 3. Single End-to-End Pipeline ✅

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Changes Made**:
  - Implemented analyze_ranked_articles function
  - Created UserContext model for consistent user information
  - Integrated scraping and analysis in a single workflow
  - Added proper error handling and logging
- **Next Steps**:
  - Add progress tracking for long-running analyses
  - Implement parallel processing for faster analysis
  - Add support for saving intermediate results

### 4. Prompt Engineering and LLM Tooling ✅

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Changes Made**:
  - Created ARTICLE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT with structured sections
  - Implemented response parsing for LLM output
  - Added error handling for malformed responses
- **Next Steps**:
  - Refine prompts based on user feedback
  - Add more specialized prompts for different article types
  - Implement A/B testing for prompt effectiveness

### 5. Error Handling & Logging ✅

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added comprehensive logging throughout the codebase
  - Implemented retry logic for scraping
  - Added error handling for LLM responses
  - Created fallback mechanisms for content extraction
- **Next Steps**:
  - Add more detailed error reporting
  - Implement error recovery strategies
  - Add monitoring for system health

### 6. File/Module Structure ✅

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Changes Made**:
  - Created agent.py with core functionality
  - Implemented agent_tools.py for scraping and analysis
  - Added agent_prompts.py for prompt management
  - Organized code into logical modules
- **Next Steps**:
  - Add unit tests for each module
  - Create integration tests for the full pipeline
  - Add documentation for each module

### 7. Archon Integration ✅

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Changes Made**:
  - Integrated with Pydantic AI for model validation
