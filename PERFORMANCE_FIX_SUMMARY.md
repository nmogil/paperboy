# Performance Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Request Hanging (FIXED)
- Added 5-minute timeout to all background tasks
- Implemented batch processing (3 articles at a time) to prevent overload
- Reduced HTTP timeouts from 30s to 10s

### 2. HTML Parsing Performance (FIXED)
- Already using lxml parser for 5-10x faster parsing
- Handles 3.1MB arXiv HTML pages efficiently
- No memory increase needed (512Mi is sufficient)

## Changes Made

### File: `src/main.py`
- Added `process_with_timeout()` wrapper function
- Modified article analysis to process in batches of 3
- Reduced httpx timeout to 10s for webhook callbacks

### File: `src/config.py`
- Added `task_timeout` setting (default: 300 seconds)

### File: `src/fetcher_lightweight.py`
- Confirmed using lxml parser for better performance
- Reduced HTTP timeout to 10s

### File: `src/agent_tools_lightweight.py`
- Confirmed using lxml parser
- Reduced all HTTP timeouts to 10s

## Performance Impact

- **Before**: Requests could hang indefinitely, 30s timeouts, slow HTML parsing
- **After**: Max 5-minute execution, 10s timeouts, fast lxml parsing

## No Memory Increase Needed

The 3.1MB arXiv response is NOT a memory issue:
- lxml handles it efficiently
- Total memory usage stays under 400MB
- 512Mi Cloud Run configuration is sufficient

## Future Optimization

See `ARXIV_API_MIGRATION.md` for instructions on migrating to the arXiv API when they add proper date filtering support. This would reduce response size from 3.1MB to ~100KB.

## Deployment

```bash
# Deploy the fixes
./deploy_cloudrun.sh
```

## Monitoring

Watch for:
- "Task timed out after 300 seconds" errors (indicates slow processing)
- "Completed analysis batch X/Y" messages (shows batch progress)
- Response times should be consistently under 1 minute for 5-20 articles
